# Instructions about the power config files

## Power server config files

The `server*.cfg` files are the config files for the Power Server machine. They are needed to run the `server.py` script on the Power Server.
They specify the NTP server IP, PTD daemon path, power meter type, channel index, and power meter IP.

## Power Settings documentation files

The `power-settings*.md` files contain the iDRAC and/or BIOS configuration settings that were applied on each system that power was analyzed on.
