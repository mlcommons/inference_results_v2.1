# GX2570M6 System Architecture

Fujitsu's GX2570M6 Server supports the GPUDirect capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data directly from PCIe devices
(e.g. network, storage or camera) to GPU device memory. Each pair of A100 GPUs in the system is connected to a PCIe-Gen4 bridge,
which is also connected to two network interfaces.

The highest bandwidth requirement for any of Fujitsu's submission is dlrm-Offline which requires 8.6GB/s per GPU.
Fujitsu has measured over 20 GB/s per GPU with our experimental environment.
